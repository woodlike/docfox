> â¥¿ Reusable stateful UX behavior with Hooks

## Getting started

```bash
# Yarn users
yarn add @wdlk/hooks
# NPM users
npm -i @wdlk/hooks
```

## The problem

We've recognized that interface design requirements change continually and faster than behavior, on the flip side, user experience needs to be consistent and endure the lifetime of ever-changing interfaces. @wdlk/hooks give you the flexibility to comply with these ever-existing changes.

## The solution

UX Hooks are reusable stateful functions and helpers that provide different types of UX behavior to your React components. It creates state and passes down the UX logic to the children, so you can handle your behavior. It also opens browser relevant imperative APIs directly into React's declarative component composition. It provides UXs consistency avoiding the repeated implementation of stateful behavioral patterns within your web application. For more detailed information about Hooks, you can take a look at the [docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html).
