## Requirements

🚀 Node.js >=8
🌲 Git

## Motivation

Are reusable stateless functional components that are coherent to a design system. It uses [Theme-UI](https://theme-ui.com/) under the hood to provide a design system constrained development. With this approach, the theme object becomes the heart of a user interface identity without setting constraints on layout and design decisions.

```sh
yarn add @wdk/components
```
